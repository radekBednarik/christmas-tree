## Notice

This was my first foray into this area of drawing something on the screen and therefore code is far from good.
Also my first or second time with p5.js and I realized some expectations of that library too late in the game.

This was to be supposed short one day project for fun and that was kind of achieved.

Next Christmas I will maybe attempt to redo this to get this work at least a bit better.

**Merry Christmas!**
